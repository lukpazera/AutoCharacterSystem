# Get Started

## Requirements
MODO 14.2v1, Windows, OSX

## Installation

**Previous ACS version users**: there is no need for uninstalling ACS1 or ACS2. ACS3 is a separate product therefore you can have both Auto Character Setup (1 or 2) and Auto Character System 3 installed inside MODO at the same time.


### Windows | OSX

- Go to **Releases** page by clicking on the right side of the repository view.
- Click and download .zip installation file for a chosen release. Unzip its contents to a temporary location.
- Open MODO’s **Content** folder using **System** menu and copy unpacked **AutoCharacterSystem3** folder with all its contents into **Content/Kits** subfolder.

- If you use custom location for MODO content you have to copy unpacked **AutoCharacterSystem3** folder into that location’s **/Kits** subfolder.
- Restart MODO.
- **OSX USERS**: If you are using OSX Catalina or newer this system will throw an error (and may crash Modo) saying that *"RiggingSystem.lx is from an unverified developer"*. You need to go to **System Preferences/Security and Privacy/General**. Look for a warning that **RiggingSystem.lx** was blocked towards bottom of the panel. There will be **Allow Anyway** button next to the warning. Use that button and restart MODO.

## Uninstallation
To uninstall software you simply need to delete the **AutoCharacterSystem3** folder from the location in which the product was initiallly installed. By default it will be inside MODO **Content/Kits** subfolder (see instructions under **Installation** to navigate to that folder).

## Manual
